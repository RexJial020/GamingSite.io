      <p>Hades 2 takes place some time after the events of the first game, where Chronos, the Titan of Time, has revived and attacked Hades and his family, capturing most of them. The game follows Melinoë, a cthonic nymph and Hades’ sister, who has been trained by Hecate, the goddess of magic, witchcraft, and the crossroads. Melinoë’s mission is to rescue her family and kill Chronos, her grandfather.

        According to the game’s reveal trailer, Melinoë will be setting off on a rescue mission that doubles as an assassination. Her journey will take her through the Underworld, where she will encounter various mythological creatures and characters from Greek mythology.
        
        The game’s story is still unfolding, and more details will be revealed as the game progresses through Early Access and updates. However, it is known that the game will explore the rich world of Greek mythology, incorporating the myth’s “deep connections to the dawn of witchcraft” and featuring Hecate, the secretive goddess of magic, witchcraft, and the crossroads, as a significant character.</p>
